The data is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

As part of further learning of the concepts for getting and cleaning data, this repo is intended to process the original data set into a specific data format that can be used to further investigate and analyse the possibilty of classifying human activity using data collected from a smartphone, Samsung Galaxy S. The data comes from a combination of the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope sensors.

	==================================================================
	
	The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

	The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

The repo contains the following files:

1. "README.md" 

2. "Codebook.md" : Describes the information for variables.

3. "run_analysis.R" : Performs the data processing - see below for explanation. 

4. "tidySamsungGalaxyS.txt" : Output of the script.




=====================================================================================================================


The script run_analysis.R does the following:
1. Downloads the data 
2. Extracts only the mean and standard deviation data 
3. Combines the separate pieces of data into a single data frame
4. Calculates the mean for each variable based on both subject and activity 
4. Outputs the results into a file called "tidySamsungGalaxyS.txt"

Please review the file Codebook.md for further explanation of the variables.
